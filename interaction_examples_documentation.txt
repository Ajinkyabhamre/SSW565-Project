Make security group API work like documentation All the documentation for the security group API has stated description is optional.

Test coverage for network v2 security group rules client According to the tempest lib documentation [0]: "When adding a new interface to the library we need to at a minimum have unit test coverage. A proposed change to add an interface to tempest/lib that doesn't have unit tests shouldn't be accepted. Ideally these unit tests will provide sufficient coverage to ensure a stable interface moving forward." Thus test coverage should be provided for existing clients in tempest.lib that lack unit tests.

Disable Neutron port security driver on upgrades When upgrading from Kilo to Liberty, networks existing prior to the upgrade prevented new VMs from booting. This was due to the introduction of the port_security extension to Neutron's defaults in the openstack-ansible Liberty release. This change disables the port_security driver in environments upgrading from Kilo, with documentation informing deployers of the change. Greenfield Liberty environments do not experience this behavior, as the port_security driver is enabled for all networks created there. Upstream Neutron do not currently provide a mechanism for adding port_security binding information to pre-existing networks, nor does it fail gracefully. Hence, this patch is deemed the least invasive way to work around the issue for openstack-ansible. This depends on Change-Id: I3838374467fe7cb35222a80d78095af806114b1a being present in liberty.

Making section id names readable in security guide In the security guide, the section id names are the chapter name with a random id number on the end. This is harder to work with and not really necessary, for example, case-studies-system-documentation-idp44480. Replacing section id names with "case-studies-system-documentation-alice-private-cloud". Changing the ids at the section definitions throughout. No references are made to these section ids within security guide and hence no changes needed there.

Improved security group rule editing. Splits rule editing and rule creation out so that rather than being on one modal form (which is dismissed after taking any action on the rules) they are instead contained in their own security group detail view, with create/delete as their own discrete forms/actions which return to that same view. This also reworks the form to be more explicit and user-friendly in terms of the various options provided, making it more responsive, and making it better documented. Incidentally fixes some problems in the documentation. Implements blueprint security-group-rules. Change-Id: I866dd4fe0c74148140422aab9172be4f496689a9

Don't allow EC2 removal of security group in use. Fix bug 817872. This patch modifies the behavior of removing security groups via the EC2 API to better match the EC2 API spec. The EC2 documentation says that a group that is still in use can not be removed. A new function has been added to the db API to find out whether a particular security group is still in use. "In use" is defined as applied to an active instance, or applied to another group that has not been deleted. Unit tests have been updated to ensure that an error is raised when these conditions are hit. Change-Id: I5b3fdf1da213b04084fe266c1a6ed92e01cf1e19
